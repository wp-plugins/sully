System Update Logger - Record system updates including plugins, themes and core updates.

== Description ==

With WordPress 3.7, updates happen automatically for you, however there is only e-mail notifications sent.  WordPress has a robust administration interface so SULly records all system updates (either automatic or manually done through the admin interface) in to a table and presents the last 10 updates to you in a dashboard widget.

This code is released under the GPL v2, see license.txt for details.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the SULly folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.
3. Login to WordPress and add the widget to your dashboard.
