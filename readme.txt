System Update Logger - Record system updates including plugins, themes and core updates.

== Description ==

With WordPress 3.7, updates happen automatically for you, however there is only e-mail notifications sent.  WordPress has a robust administration interface so SULly records all system updates (either automatic or manually done through the admin interface) in to a table and presents the last 10 updates to you in a dashboard widget.

Also note that this plugin can only display logs for items installed after SULly itself is installed.

This code is released under the GPL v2, see license.txt for details.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the SULly folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.
3. Login to WordPress and add the widget to your dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't SULly show me update from before I installed it? =

WordPress doesn't record this information anywhere so SULly hooks in to the download and update hooks in WordPress 3.7 to keep track of these changes, but that means it has to be installed before it can record the updates.  

= I updated a plugin and the change log in SULly is blank but does have a readme.txt and a change log is there, what's wrong? =

As much as there is a standard for change logs in WordPress's readme standard, it is open to interpretation by plugin authors.

The code in SULly should catch most change logs but if you find one that doesn't, go to the support forum (http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/sully) for SULly on WordPress.org and post a link to the plugin and I'll see what I can do to update the code to catch the change log.

= The manual and system change log entries have a date that's different from when I made the change, why? =

The manual and system change types are only captured the next time someone loads the admin interface, so they may have different time's on them than you expect.
