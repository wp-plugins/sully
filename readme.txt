System Update Logger - Record system updates including plugins, themes and core updates.

== Description ==

With WordPress 3.7, updates happen automatically for you, however there is only e-mail notifications sent.  WordPress has a robust administration interface so SULly records all system updates (either automatic or manually done through the admin interface) in to a table and presents the last 10 updates to you in a dashboard widget.
